To Do:

1. Print out of user inputs with list of calculated variables below
2. Add more calculations
3. Combine with KIVY
4. Turn dictionary items to integers


Total list of calculations so far:

- completed:
  - MU = (E * RR) / (CR - 1)
  - MU = CR * BD
  - CR = MU / BD
  - CR = CTC / MUC
  - CR = (E + BD) / BD
  - E = MU - BD
  - E = (CR * BD) - BD
  - E = DT * RR * .00085
  - BD = E / (CR - 1)
  - BD = MU - E
  - BD = MU / CR
  - List user inputs
  - Add better invalid responses
