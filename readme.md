To Do:

- Turn dictionary items to integers for calculations
- Run calculations
- Print calculations with no repeats
- Combine with KIVY
- Add more calculations

Total list of calculations so far:
  - MU = (E * RR) / (CR - 1)
  - MU = CR * BD
  - CR = MU / BD
  - CR = CTC / MUC
  - CR = (E + BD) / BD
  - E = MU - BD
  - E = (CR * BD) - BD
  - E = DT * RR * .00085
  - BD = E / (CR - 1)
  - BD = MU - E
  - BD = MU / CR
